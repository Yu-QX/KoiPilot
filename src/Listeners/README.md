# Description for `Listeners` Module

The `Listeners` module manages all interactions with AI APIs.

API requests are routed through `Listeners.main`, where the specific AI to be used is determined.

Each subfolder within the module contains a dedicated listener series. The versioning of listeners is handled internally within their respective folders.
